Version 1.1
 
- Added detection for the following resources: 
  * javaCheckStyle.xml
  * Localizable.strings
  * .plist
  * .wsdd
   
- Proper detection of the "pbprojectdump" binary on Leopard
 
- Handling of localization (.lproj) directories
 
- A nice println to notify the user that the job is complete
 
- Put the good Application class (with the package) into build.properties.  
If you have Application.java classed in more than one package, it will select the last one.
